# Processing 3 

Tese projects orginate to an intro to graphic design class I took at the College of Charleston. These projects use Processing which is based off of Java. This language has helped introduce me to more sophisticated concepts in java like methods, loops, and data input. All of these projects originate from throught puzzles or homework assignments in class!
